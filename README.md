# VolunTutor

Project Title: VolunTutor
Description: A web system which allows users to sign up to tutor others and to 
search for available tutors. Users will be able to create reservations on our 
built-in calendar with other users for either in-person sessions or on our 
real-time chat system. We have a rating and review system so users will have 
an idea about the quality of tutoring they may receive ahead of time. 
Additionally, there will be certain achievements awarded to the most exemplary 
of tutors to show off on their profiles.
